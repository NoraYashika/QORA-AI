# Planning
## General Planning
- [x] Making a usage guide 📖
- [ ] Adding execution parameters 🧰🔧
- [ ] Making a GUI 🖥
- [ ] Making it cross-compatible with all operating systems, capable of using python ⚙
- [ ] <strong>possibly</strong> rewriting the System in an other language 🧰

## Making importable Modules 🧩
- [ ] a time module, to tell the current time and date. ⏲📅
- [ ] a translation plugin, to make it able to communicate with the user in a set language 🅰➡🅱
- [ ] a translator module, to make it able to translate from one language into another set language 🅰➡🅱
- [ ] a module to evaluate data and make rough predictions 💭

## Planning regarding the neural network 
- [ ] making it learn from user input and mistakes 👍👎
- [ ] a way to take out any bias out of the network 🧠
- [ ] increasing the accurracy and taking out interpretation errors ❌

The file "intents.json" is constantly being updated to increase the vocabulary of the neural network and I try to release Updates on a bi-weekly basis. 🔄

if you have any requests or ideas, open an issue, I am all ears!! 😀

## About
This project started in 2021, originally as a way to learn about <a href = "https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and AI/Machine Learning in general. Later on I started to expanding it and after a year I rediscovered it and thought to myself "Why do I not work on it again, since it was so much fun when I last did it?". So, here I am.
